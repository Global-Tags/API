# GlobalTags Rules

The GlobalTags system is provided for use by players and developers in the Minecraft community. We allow a lot of freedom in the choice of tags, but there are some limits that must not be exceeded. Your use of the service is subject to the following conditions:

1. Advertisement of any kind **is allowed**.
2. Any form of racism/extremism is **not** allowed.
3. Curse words are allowed as long as they don't insult or target a specific user or group
4. Sharing any information about another person without their consent is **strictly forbidden**. This is also referred to as <u>doxing</u>.
5. Icons must not include inappropriate content, such as NSFW material, gore, or other offensive imagery.
6. You must not violate any applicable laws or regulations.
7. It is not allowed to exploit bugs or vulnerabilities within the API or mod implementation to gain unfair advantage.

Violating these rules may result in a permanent suspension from GlobalTags services, without any refunds for prior purchases. See <a href="https://globaltags.xyz/legal/terms" target="_blank">General Terms and Conditions</a>
