# GlobalTags Rules

The GlobalTags system is provided for use by players and developers in the Minecraft community. We allow a lot of freedom in the choice of tags, but there are some limits that must not be exceeded. Your use of the service is subject to the following conditions:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

1. Advertisement of any kind **is allowed**.
2. Any form of racism/extremism is **not** allowed.
3. Curse words are allowed as long as they don't insult or target a specific user or group.
4. Sharing sensitive information about any person, including yourself, is **strictly prohibited**, regardless of consent. This practice, commonly referred to as *doxing*, includes but is not limited to:
    1. Full names
    2. Telephone numbers
    3. Addresses
    4. Coordinates or any other means of sharing specific locations
5. Icons must not include inappropriate content, such as NSFW material, gore, or other offensive imagery.
6. You must not violate any applicable laws or regulations.
7. It is not allowed to exploit bugs or vulnerabilities within the API or mod implementation to gain unfair advantage.
8. Creating unnecessary whitespaces, whether intentionally or accidentally, is strongly discouraged. (1)

</div>

1. For example, avoid putting spaces after color codes as this results in a whitespace:
    
    | ✅ | ❌ |
    | :---: | :---: |
    | `&5Test Tag` | `&5 Test Tag` |
    | `<#ff0000>My cool tag!` | `<#ff0000> My cool tag!` |

Violating these rules may result in a permanent suspension from GlobalTags services, without any refunds for prior purchases. See <a href="https://globaltags.xyz/legal/terms" target="_blank">General Terms and Conditions</a>
